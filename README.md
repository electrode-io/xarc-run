## Features

- **_Support [namespaces](./REFERENCE.md#namespace) for tasks._**
- Load and execute npm scripts from `package.json`.
- Auto completion for [bash] and [zsh].
- Define tasks in a JavaScript file.
- Serial tasks execution.
- Concurrent tasks execution.
- Proper nesting task execution hierarchy.
- Promise, [node.js stream], or callback support for tasks written in JavaScript.
- Run time flow control - return further tasks to execute from JS task function.
- Support custom task execution reporter.
- Specify complex tasks execution pattern from command line.
- Tasks can have a [_finally_](./REFERENCE.md#finally-hook) hook that always runs after task finish or fail.
- Support [flexible function task](./REFERENCE.md#function) that can return more tasks to run.

## Why

[npm scripts] is a quick and convenient place for simple build scripts but it's so simple there are some limitations:

- You have to be careful to write scripts that work cross platforms
- A single string in a JSON file may not be enough sometimes to fit a build script
- Your only option is JS to do some of your bidding sometimes
- No stream support, flow control, or extending or customizing

xclap picks up where [npm scripts] left off.

It's most useful if you need to write reusable build scripts that use shell commands and JavaScript, and that's the primary purpose it was created for.

Some typical use cases:

- [namespaces](./REFERENCE.md#namespace) lets your users overload some of your tasks but still able to reference them.
- Write complex build steps with comprehensive and powerful flow control like `dependent` and `finally` hooks, and serial and concurrent executions.
- Advanced handling of JavaScript as part of the build steps allow integrating them directly with shell commands.

### npm scripts

You can execute your [npm scripts] directly with xclap, even multiple of them concurrently or serially.

- serially: `clap -n -x script1 script2 script3`
- concurrently: `clap -n script1 script2 script3`

Basically, if you specify the `--npm` (`-n`) option then all npm scripts in your `package.json` are loaded into the namespace `npm`.

You can enable this by default by setting the option in your `package.json` also.

Similar to [npm], xclap execute these scripts with `tty` so concurrency may be affected if you run multiple commands that reads input from `tty`.

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
$ npm install xclap --save-dev
```

If you'd like to get the command `clap` globally, you can install another small npm module [xclap-cli] globally.

```bash
$ npm install -g xclap-cli
```

### A Quick Tasks Example

You can define your tasks in a JavaScript file, allowing you do anything that's possible with JS.

Here is a simple sample. Save it to `xclap.js` and xclap will automatically load it.

```js
"use strict";

const util = require("util");
const xclap = require("xclap");
const { exec, concurrent, serial, env } = xclap;
const rimraf = util.promisify(require("rimraf"));

const tasks = {
  hello: "echo hello world",
  jsFunc() {
    console.log("JS hello world");
  },
  both: {
    desc: "invoke tasks hello and jsFunc in serial order",
    // only array at top level like this is default to serial, other times
    // they are default to concurrent, or they can be marked explicitly
    // with the serial and concurrent APIs (below).
    task: ["hello", "jsFunc"]
  },
  // invoke tasks hello and jsFunc concurrently as a simple concurrent array
  both2: concurrent("hello", "jsFunc"),
  shell: {
    desc: "Run a shell command with TTY control and set an env",
    task: exec({ cmd: "echo test", flags: "tty", env: { foo: "bar" } })
  },
  babel: exec("babel src -D lib"),
  // serial array of two tasks, first one to set env, second to invoke the babel task.
  compile: serial(env({ BABEL_ENV: "production" }), "babel"),
  // more complex nesting serial/concurrent tasks.
  build: {
    desc: "Run production build",
    task: serial(
      () => rimraf("dist"), // cleanup, (returning a promise will be awaited)
      env({ NODE_ENV: "production" }), // set env
      concurrent("babel", exec("webpack")) // invoke babel task and run webpack concurrently
    )
  }
};

xclap.load(tasks);
```

> Init an npm project and save the file to disk as `xclap.js`:

```bash
$ npm init --yes && npm install rimraf xclap && npm install -g xclap-cli
```

> Then invoke one of the tasks:

```bash
$ clap hello
hello world
$ clap both
hello world
JS hello world
```

> You can name the file `clapfile.js` or `clap.js` if you prefer.

### TypeScript

Name your task file `xclap.ts` if you want to use TypeScript.

You also need to install [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) to your `node_modules`

ie:

```bash
npm install -D ts-node typescript
```

xclap automatically loads `ts-node/register` when it detects `xclap.ts` file.

### Command Usage

Any task can be invoked with the command `clap`:

```bash
$ clap task1 [task1 options] [<task2> ... <taskN>]
```

ie:

```bash
$ clap build
```

For help on usage:

```bash
$ clap -h
```

To load [npm scripts] into the `npm` namespace, use the `-n` option:

```bash
$ clap -n test
```

You can also specify command line options under `xclap` in your `package.json`.

#### Specifying Complex Tasks from command line

You can specify your tasks as an array from the command line.

For example, to have `xclap` execute the tasks `[ task_a, task_b ]` concurrently:

```bash
$ clap [ task_a, task_b ]
```

You can also execute them serially with:

```bash
$ clap -x [ task_a, task_b ]
```

You can execute tasks serially, and then some tasks concurrently:

```bash
$ clap -x [task_a, task_b, [task_c1, task_c2]]
```

> will execute `task_a`, then `task_b`, and finally `task_c1` and `task_c2` concurrently.

You can pass the whole array in as a single string, which will be parsed as an array with string elements only.

```bash
$ clap "[task_a, task_b, [task_c1, task_c2]]"
```

#### Task Name

Task name is any alphanumeric string that does not contain `/`, or starts with `?` or `~$`.

Tasks can be invoked from command line:

- `xclap foo/task1` indicates to execute `task1` in namespace `foo`
- `xclap ?task1` or `xclap ?foo/task1` indicates that executing `task1` is optional.

`xclap` treats these characters as special:

- `/` as namespace separator
- prefix `?` to let you indicate that the execution of a task is optional so it won't fail if the task is not found.
- prefix `~$` to indicate the task to be a string as a shell command

#### Optional Task Execution

By prefixing the task name with `?` when invoking, you can indicate the execution of a task as optional so it won't fail in case the task is not found.

For example:

- `xclap ?foo/task1` or `xclap ?task1` won't fail if `task1` is not found.

#### Task Definition

A task can be `string`, `array`, `function`, or `object`. See [reference](./REFERENCE.md#task-definition) for details.

### package.json

You can define xclap tasks and options in your `package.json`.

#### Tasks

You can also define **xclap** tasks without JavaScript capability in an object `xclap.tasks` in your `package.json`.

They will be loaded into a namespace `pkg`.

For example:

```js
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "xclap": {
    "tasks": {
      "task1": "echo hello from package.json",
      "task2": "echo hello from package.json",
      "foo": ["task1", "task2"]
    }
  }
}
```

And you can invoke them with `clap pkg/foo`, or `clap foo` if there are no other namespace with a task named `foo`.

#### Options

xclap command line options can also be specified in `xclap` inside your `package.json`.

For example:

```js
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "xclap": {
    "npm": true
  }
}
```

### Async Tasks

You can provide a JS function for a task that executes asynchrounously. Your function just need to take a callback or return a Promise or a [node.js stream].

ie:

```js
const tasks = {
  cb_async: (cb) => {
    setTimeout(cb, 10);
  },
  promise_async: () => {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(resolve, 10);
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

One of the common use of `xclap` is to write cross platform build scripts that work on \*nix and Windows, but npm scripts are effectively executed by the shell and they are prone to break on different platforms.

### Environment Variables

ie: The following would work on bash but not Windows.

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "prod-build": "NODE_ENV=production npm run build",
    "build": "webpack",
    "compile": "BABEL_ENV=production babel src -D lib"
  }
}
```

In xclap JS task they would work on all platforms:

```js
const xclap = require("xclap");
const { env, exec } = xclap;

const tasks = {
  "prod-build": [env({ NODE_ENV: "production" }), "build"],
  build: "webpack",
  compile: exec("babel src -D lib", { env: { BABEL_ENV: "production" } })
};

xclap.load(tasks);
```
